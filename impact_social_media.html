			Now <b>Social Media</b> has always been about being included in the lives of those who you decide to interact with, whether that be friends, families or celebrities, social media is a means to share with your following what you're doing, where you are, where you have travelled and to show all the stuff you've been up to. Now with the upcoming technology Collaborative Telepresence, this could be a whole new way for others to share their experiences. A new form factor as it relates to social media could be derived, instead of individuals seeing just posts, pictures or videos of what you wanted to share imagine a world where your follows are able to experience it themselves. It would allow your followers to be immersed in whatever you are sharing, they can see what you can see, hear what you hear, feel what you feel. It would be a completely new era in social media, one more wholesome and more submersive.
