			The impact that can be seen within the spectrum of <b>Education</b> would be truly significant with the use of Collabrative Technology. More specifically as it regards to vocational training and hand-on skills it will greatly transform the learning curve for those learning anything new. Whether that be plumbing, carpentry, welding or med students learning the skills necessary for various surgeries this tech can be truly useful to those students learning these skills that can have their bodies manipulated and controlled by their teachers to guide them and teach them with precision and accuracy. To accomplish this some form of hardware would be connected to the student to control the arms and has the student's field of view all being operated by the instructor from a remote area.
