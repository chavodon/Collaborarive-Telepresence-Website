			The impact on <b>Media and Entertainment</b> would be similar to that of Social Media however this would direct mainly to various events consumed by individuals regularly for entetainment such as sporting events, concerts, video games among a plethora of other activities. This would change how people consume these various products, if an individual can still get the real life feeling of a sporting event or concert from the comfort of their home it would render distance meaningless. You could be supporting your favourite football club week in week out from within the comfort and safety of your own home here in Jamaica. No longer would one have to worry about transportation as it would no longer pose a problem for anyone trying to partake in the various forms of media and entertainment.
